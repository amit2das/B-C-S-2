A motivating example is the ubiquitous data-summarization problem in machine learning and information retrieval where one is given a collection of feature vectors that represent data such as documents or images. The volume of a collection of vectors is used as a measure of their diversity, and partition or matroid constraints over [m] are imposed in order to ensure resource or fairness constraints. Even with a simple cardinality constraint (B = ( [m]/r ), the problem becomes NP-hard and has received much attention starting with a result by Khachiyan [J. Complexity, 11 (1995) pp. 138-153] who gave an rO(r) approximation algorithm for a special case of this problem. Recently, Nikolov and Singh [Proceedings of the Forty-eighth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2016, pp. 192-201] presented a convex program and showed how it can be used to estimate the value of the most diverse set when there are multiple cardinality constraints (i.e., when B corresponds to a partition matroid). Their proof of the integrality gap of the convex program relied on an inequality by Gurvits [Proceedings of the Thirty-eighth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, 2006, pp. 417-426], and was recently extended to regular matroids [Straszak and Vishnoi, Proceedings of the Forty-ninth ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2017, pp. 370-383] and [Anaris and Gharan, Proceedings of the Forty-ninth Annual SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2017, pp. 384-396] and general matroids [Anari, Gharan, and Vinzant, Proceedings of the Fifty-ninth IEEE Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2018, pp. 35-46]. The question of whether these estimation algorithms can be converted into the more useful approximation algorithms-that also output a set-remained open. The main contribution of this paper is to give the first approximation algorithms for both partition and regular matroids. We present novel formulations for the subdeterminant maximization problem, for these matroids; this reduces them to the problem of finding a point that maximizes the absolute value of a nonconvex function over a Cartesian product of probability simplices. The technical core of our results is a new anti-concentration inequality for dependent random variables that arise from these functions, which allows us to relate the optimal value of these nonconvex functions to their value at a random point. Unlike prior work on the constrained subdeterminant maximization problem, our proofs do not rely on real-stability or convexity and could be of independent interest both in algorithms and complexity where anti-concentration phenomena have recently been deployed.

Existing online evaluation methods are difficult to reliably evaluate the error of voltage transformers under actual non-stationary output. Therefore, a evaluation method based on ACFLDRM(autocorrelation function and large-dimensional random matrices) for electronic voltage transformers is proposed. For the non-stationary measurement data of electronic voltage transformers, the autocorrelation function and differential method are used to extract stationary parameter. By single-ring law, evaluation limit and real-time indexes are extracted.

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) is one of the most known approaches for predicting diabetes. Many researchers have found by combining KNN with one or more other algorithms may provide a better result. In this paper, a combination of three procedures, removing noise, reducing the dimension, and weighting distance, is proposed to improve a standard voting-based KNN to classify Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) into two classes. First, the noises in the training set are removed using k-means clustering (KMC) to make the voter data in both classes more competent. Second, its dimensional is then reduced to decrease the intra-class data distances but increase the inter-class ones. Two methods of dimensional reduction: principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoder (AE), are applied to investigate the linearity of the dataset. Since there is an imbalance on the dataset, a proportional weight is incorporated into the distance formula to get the fairness of the voting. A 5-fold cross validation-based evaluation shows that each proposed procedure works very well in enhancing the KNN. KMC is capable of increasing the accuracy of KNN from 81.6% to 86.7%. Combining KMC and PCA improves the KNN accuracy to be 90.9%. Next, a combination of KMC and AE enhances the KNN to gives an accuracy of 97.8%. Combining three proposed procedures of KMC, PCA, and Weighted KNN (WKNN) increases the accuracy to be 94.5%. Finally, the combination of KMC, AE, and WKNN reaches the highest accuracy of 98.3%. The facts that AE produces higher accuracies than PCA inform that the features in the dataset have a high non-linearity. © 2020 IEEE.",autoencoder; diabetes; k-means clustering; k-nearest neighbors; principal component analysis,Classification (of information);

Question paper is the primary tool used in an examination, the quality of question paper plays an important role in a student's future. Hence, any individual should take utmost care while framing the question paper. However, setting up a good question paper for assessment is not a straightforward task, particularly when students come from different backgrounds and intellect. So parameters which need to pay attention are fairness, consistency, novelty and elimination of bias while selecting questions in the question paper. This paper explores the possibility of using knowledge graph technology and deep learning. Knowledge graph in particular, addressing syllabus fairness and deep learning for novelty check. The objective is to propose a feasible framework, taking into consideration several aspects. These aspects are: to meet at least three levels of bloom taxonomy, support of course outcomes (CO) and Program Outcomes (PO) attainment. They are achieved by judging syllabus fairness, support for judging more spontaneous answering potential with novelty checks. The prototype implemented using this framework showed promising results motivating for further research. © 2020 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; Assessment; Bloom taxonomy; Deep Learning; Question Paper,Knowledge representation; Artificial intelligent techniques; Bloom taxonomies; Education systems; Knowledge graphs; Program outcomes; Deep learning,,,,,,,,"https://www.aicte-india.org/sites/default/files/ExaminationReforms.pdf, AICTIndia; Bohra, A.P., Kummamuru, K., Sahu, S., Shivkumar, A., Determining comprehensiveness of question paper given syllabus (2016) U.S. Patent 9, 430, 952, , International Business Machines Corp 2016; Dicheva, D., Sosnovsky, S., Gavrilova, T., Brusilovsky, P., Ontological web portal for educational ontologies (2005) SW-EL'05: Applications of Semantic Web Technologies for E-Learning, p. 19; Serhatli, M., Alpaslan, F.N., An ontology based question answering system on software test document domain (2009) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 54 (9); Rekha, R., Angadi, A., Pathak, A., Kapur, A., Gosar, H., Ramanathan, M., Thatte, V., Sasikumar, M., Ontology driven framework for assessing the syllabus fairness of a question paper (2012) 2012 Ieee International Conference on Technology Enhanced Education (ICTEE), pp. 1-5. , January).

To adequately use machine learning devices in medical services, some constraints must be measured and key points must be measured, for example, its clinical use and ethics in the use of medical services. Favorable circumstances of machine learning incorporate adaptability and versatility contrasted and conventional biostatistical strategies, which makes it deployable for some errands, for example, hazard separation, finding and grouping, and endurance expectations. The health care services measure includes a lot of gigantic information that can be of various kinds and put in better places.

Nonetheless, it is increasingly required that decision-making procedures must be explainable and fair. As many applications are based on black-box models, there is a strong need for more explainable AI algorithms. For this reason, our paper explores the practical implications and effectiveness of four bias mitigation algorithms (learning fair representations, reweighing, Equality of Odds, and Reject Option based Classification) based on a standard XGBoost classifier to build an explainable and fair prediction model on a real-world loan dataset. The models were evaluated based on their performance, fairness, and explainability. Potential biases, i.e. fairness, were detected with the use of NLP techniques and evaluated with the AIF360 metrics, whereas the explainability of the model was tested by post-hoc explanations (SHAP method). The best results were obtained by the reweighing algorithm that improved the fairness while maintaining a high model performance and explainability. © 2020 IEEE.",explainable artificial intelligence; fairness; machine learning; XAI,Classification (of information); Decision making; Intelligent computing; Machine learning; AI algorithms; Black-box model; Decision making procedure; Fair representation; Model performance; Nlp techniques; Prediction model; Real-world; Predictive analytics,,,,,,,,"Lipton, Z.C., The mythos of model interpretability (2018) ACM Queue, 61 (3), pp. 31-57; Lundberg, S., Lee, S.I., A Unified approach to interpreting model predictions Adv.

Notably, major technical shifts in e-commerce aim to influence customer behavior in favor of some products and brands. Artificial intelligence (AI) comes on board as an essential innovative tool for personalization and customizing products to meet specific demands. This research finds that, despite the contribution of AI systems in e-commerce, its ethical soundness is a contentious issue, especially regarding the concept of explainability. The study adopted the use of word cloud analysis, voyance analysis, and concordance analysis to gain a detailed understanding of the idea of explainability as has been utilized by researchers in the context of AI. Motivated by a corpus analysis, this research lays the groundwork for a uniform front, thus contributing to a scientific breakthrough that seeks to formulate Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models. XAI is a machine learning field that inspects and tries to understand the models and steps involved in how the black box decisions of AI systems are made; it provides insights into the decision points, variables, and data used to make a recommendation. This study suggested that, to deploy explainable XAI systems, ML models should be improved, making them interpretable and comprehensible. © 2020 by the author.

Currently, AI is recognized in the broader technology radar within the five key technologies which emerge for their wide-ranging applications and impact in communities, companies, business, and value chain framework alike. However, AI in medical imaging is at an early phase of development, and there are still hurdles to take related to reliability, user confidence, and adoption. The present narrative review aimed to provide an overview on AI-based approaches (distributed learning, statistical learning, computer-aided diagnosis and detection systems, fully automated image analysis tool, natural language processing) in oncological hybrid medical imaging with respect to clinical tasks (detection, contouring and segmentation, prediction of histology and tumor stage, prediction of mutational status and molecular therapies targets, prediction of treatment response, and outcome). Particularly, AI-based approaches have been briefly described according to their purpose and, finally lung cancer—being one of the most extensively malignancy studied by hybrid medical imaging—has been used as illustrative scenario. Finally, we discussed clinical challenges and open issues including ethics, validation strategies, effective data-sharing methods, regulatory hurdles, educational resources, and strategy to facilitate the interaction among different stakeholders. Some of the major changes in medical imaging will come from the application of AI to workflow and protocols, eventually resulting in improved patient management and quality of life. Overall, several time-consuming tasks could be automatized. Machine learning algorithms and neural networks will permit sophisticated analysis resulting not only in major improvements in disease characterization through imaging, but also in the integration of multiple-omics data (i.e., derived from pathology, genomic, proteomics, and demographics) for multi-dimensional disease featuring. Nevertheless, to accelerate the transition of the theory to practice a sustainable development plan considering the multi-dimensional interactions between professionals, technology, industry, markets, policy, culture, and civil society directed by a mindset which will allow talents to thrive is necessary. © 2020, The Author(s).",Artificial intelligence; Computer-aided diagnosis systems; Deep learning; Distributed learning; Hybrid imaging; Imaging biomarkers; Machine learning; Natural language processing; PET/CT; Radiomics,,,,,,,None.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since previous research has shown that media coverage can drive public discourse about novel technologies, studying how the ethical issues of AI are portrayed in the media may lead to greater insight into the potential ramifications of this public discourse, particularly with regard to development and regulation of AI. This paper expands upon previous research by systematically analyzing and categorizing the media portrayal of the ethical issues of AI to better understand how media coverage of these issues may shape public debate about AI. Our results suggest that the media has a fairly realistic and practical focus in its coverage of the ethics of AI, but that the coverage is still shallow. A multifaceted approach to handling the social, ethical and policy issues of AI technology is needed, including increasing the accessibility of correct information to the public in the form of fact sheets and ethical value statements on trusted webpages (e.g., government agencies), collaboration and inclusion of ethics and AI experts in both research and public debate, and consistent government policies or regulatory frameworks for AI technology. © 2020, The Author(s).",Artificial intelligence (AI); Ethics; Media; News; Public discourse; Public policy,Ethical aspects; Philosophical aspects; Public policy; Artificial intelligence technologies; Ethical considerations; Government agencies; Media; Multi-faceted approach; News; Public discourse; Regulatory frameworks; Artificial intelligence,,,,,"North Carolina State University, NCSU","Work on this paper was partially supported by an RISF Grant (V.D. and L.O., awarded to V.D.) from NC State University.",,"Agar, N., (2019) How to Be Human in the Digital Economy, p. 231 DOI. , MIT Press, Cambridge; Anderson, M., 6 key findings on how Americans see the rise of automation (2017) Pew Research Center, , https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/10/04/6-key-findings-on-how-americans-see-the-rise-of-automation/, Accessed 4 Oct, 2017; (2017) IEEE Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations in Artificial Intelligence, , Accessed 11 Oct 2018; (2014) The Morality of thinking machines: It’s time to give artificial intelligence an ethical dimension, , Accessed 11 Oct 2018; Baldini, G., Botterman, M., Neisse, R., Tallacchini, M., Ethical design in the internet of things (2018) Sci Eng Ethics, 24, pp. 905-925; Bauer, W.A., Dubljević, V., AI assistants and the paradox of internal automaticity (2019) Neuroethics; Cave, S., Coughlan, K., Dihal, K., (2019) Scary Robots, , AAAI workshop: AI, ethics, and society.

However, current data tools are still primitive when it comes to helping users trace model performance problems all the way to the data. We focus on the particular problem of slicing data to identify subsets of the validation data where the model performs poorly. This is an important problem in model validation because the overall model performance can fail to reflect that of the smaller subsets, and slicing allows users to analyze the model performance on a more granular-level. Unlike general techniques (e.g., clustering) that can find arbitrary slices, our goal is to find interpretable slices (which are easier to take action compared to arbitrary subsets) that are problematic and large. We propose mathsf{Slice Finder}SliceFinder, which is an interactive framework for identifying such slices using statistical techniques. Applications include diagnosing model fairness and fraud detection, where identifying slices that are interpretable to humans is crucial. This research is part of a larger trend of Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration and opens many opportunities for new research. © 1989-2012 IEEE.",Data slicing; model analysis; model validation,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Learning systems; Program debugging; Arbitrary subsets; Fraud detection; Granular levels; Integration approach; Model performance; Model validation; Statistical techniques; Validation data; Data integration,,,,,"Google

But most MLbased frameworks lack transparency. To believe in ML models, an individual needs to understand the reasons behind the ML predictions. In this paper, we provide a survey of open-source software tools that help explore and understand the behavior of the ML models. Also, these tools include a variety of interpretable machine learning methods that assist people with understanding the connection between input and output variables through interpretation, validate the decision of a predictive model to enable lucidity, accountability, and fairness in the algorithmic decision making policies. Furthermore, we provide the state-of-the-art of interpretable machine learning (IML) tools, along with a comparison and a brief discussion of the implementation of those IML tools in various programming languages. © 2020 IEEE.",interpretable machine learning;

However, it still remains a challenge to guarantee their trustworthiness. Fairness is one of the most critical properties of these machine learning models, while individual discriminatory cases may break the trustworthiness of these systems severely. In this paper, we present a systematic approach of testing the fairness of a machine learning model, with individual discriminatory inputs generated automatically in an adaptive manner based on the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning techniques. Our approach can explore and exploit the input space efficiently, and find more individual discriminatory inputs within less time consumption. Case studies with typical benchmark models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, compared to the state-of-the-art black-box fairness testing approaches. © 2020 IEEE.",Black-box testing; Deep reinforcement learning; Fairness testing; Machine learning models; Test data generation,Black-box testing; Decision making; Learning systems; Network security; Reinforcement learning; Turing machines; Benchmark models; Critical properties; Decision-making systems; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Machine learning models; Reinforcement learning techniques; State of the art; Time consumption; Deep learning,,,,,"GJHZ1844

These principles-explainability, fairness, privacy, accountability, transparency and soundness form the basis for trust in future AI systems. In this empirical study, we address the first principle by providing an explanation for a deep neural nenvork that is trained on a mixture of numerical, categorical and textual inputs for financial transaction classification. The explanation is achieved through (1) a feature importance analysis using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and (2) a hybrid approach of text clustering and decision tree classifiers. We then test the robustness of the model by exposing it to a targeted evasion attack, leveraging the knowledge we gained about the model through the extracted explanation. © 2020 IEEE.",AI in Finance; Decision Trees; Explainable AI; Feature Saliency; Rule Extraction; SHAP; Text Clustering,Decision trees; Intelligent computing; Knowledge management; AI systems; Decision tree classifiers; Empirical studies; Financial transactions; First principles; Hybrid approach; Importance analysis; Text Clustering; Finance,,,,,,,,"Burgt Der, J.Van, General principles for the use of Artificial Intelligence in the financial sector (2019) De Nederlandsche Bank; Zheng, X.L., Zhu, M.Y., Li, Q.B., Chen, C.C., Finbrain: When finance meets ai 2.0 (2010) Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering; Stefanel, M., Goyal, U., Artificial intelligence & financial services-cutting through the noise (2020) APIS Partners; Arrieta, A.B., Díaz-Rodríguez, N., Ser, J.D., Bennetot, A., Tabik, S., Barbado, A., García, S., Herrera, F., Explainable artificial intelligence (xai): Concepts, taxonomies, opportunities and challenges toward responsible ai (2020) Information Fusion, 58 (1), pp. 82-115; Waalen, J., Olsen, J., (2019) Chasing Cashless the Rise of Mobile Wallets in the Nordics, , Deloitte AS, Oslo, Norway; Company, M., (2019) Cash-An Inefficient and Outdated Means of Payment, , McKinsey & Company, Oslo, Norway; Barocas, S., Selbst, A., Big data's desperate impact (2016) 104 California Law Review, 671; Fromholz, J.M., The european union data privacy directive (2000) Berkeley Technology Law Journal, 15 (1), pp. 461-484; Wachter, S., Mittelstadt, B., Russel, C., Counterfactual explanations without opening the black box: Automated decisions and the GDPR (2018) Harvard Journal of Law & Technology; Lundberg, S.M., Lee, S.-I., A unified approach to interpreting model predictions (2017) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 30, pp. 4765-4774; El Mokhtari, K., Higdon, B.P., Basar, A., Interpreting financial time series with SHAP values (2019) IBM Centers for Advanced Studies Conference (CASCON), Toronto, Canada; Parisot, O., Didry, Y., Pierrick, B., Otjacques, B., Data visualization using decision trees and clustering (2014) International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications (IVAPP), Lisbon, Portugal; Polaka, I., Borisov, A., Clustering-based decision tree classifier (2010) Technological and Economic Development of Economy, 16 (4), pp. 765-781; Antwarg, L., Miller, R.M., Shapira, B., Rokach, L., Explaining anomalies detected by autoencoders using shap (2020) Journal of Artificial Intelligence; Shapley, L.S., A value for n-person games (1953) Contributions to the Theory of Games, 2 (28), pp. 307-317; Ribeiro, M.T., Singh, S., Guestrin, C., Why should i trust you explaining the predictions of any classifier (2016) ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 22, pp. 1135-1144; Ester, M., Kriegel, H.-P., Sander, J., Xu, X., A density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise (1996) AAAI, pp. 226-231; Schubert, E., Sander, J., Ester, M., Kriegel, H.P., Xu, X., DBSCAN revisited, revisited: Why and how you should (still) use dbscan (2017) ACM Trans.

Herein, we discuss how concepts of algorithmic fairness might apply in healthcare, where predictive algorithms are being increasingly used to support decision-making. Central to our discussion is the distinction between algorithmic fairness and algorithmic bias. Fairness concerns apply specifically when algorithms are used to support polar decisions (i.e., where one pole of prediction leads to decisions that are generally more desired than the other), such as when predictions are used to allocate scarce health care resources to a group of patients that could all benefit. We review different fairness criteria and demonstrate their mutual incompatibility. Even when models are used to balance benefits-harms to make optimal decisions for individuals (i.e., for non-polar decisions)–and fairness concerns are not germane–model, data or sampling issues can lead to biased predictions that support decisions that are differentially harmful/beneficial across groups. We review these potential sources of bias, and also discuss ways to diagnose and remedy algorithmic bias. We note that remedies for algorithmic fairness may be more problematic, since we lack agreed upon definitions of fairness. Finally, we propose a provisional framework for the evaluation of clinical prediction models offered for further elaboration and refinement. Given the proliferation of prediction models used to guide clinical decisions, developing consensus for how these concerns can be addressed should be prioritized. © 2020, The Author(s).",,accountable care organization; algorithm bias; Article; clinical decision making; decision making; forecasting; health disparity; human; justice; machine learning; population health management; prediction; prejudice; priority journal; software; validity,,,,,"Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, PCORI",This work was supported by two Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) grants: the Predictive Analytics Resource Center (SA.Tufts.PARC.

The technology is minimally constrained and not bound by preconceived notions or human biases. With this come novel outside the box strategies; however, the system is only capable of optimizing what it is instructed to optimize, and does not consider any ethical or political concerns. With the growing concern for systematic discrimination as a result of artificial intelligence, we acknowledge a number of relevant issues that may arise as a consequence of our new technology and categorize them into three classes. We also introduce four normative ethical approaches that are used as a framework for decision-making. Despite the focus on vaccination strategies, our goal is to improve the discussions surrounding public concern and trust over artificial intelligence and demonstrate that artificial intelligence practitioners are addressing these concerns. © 2020 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Epidemic; Ethics; Optimization; Pandemic; Policy; SARS-CoV-2; Simulation; Vaccinations,Decision making; Intelligent computing; Vaccines; AI systems; Human bias; Public concern; Social contacts; Vaccination strategy; Philosophical aspects,,,,,,,,"Abeler, J., Backer, M., Buermeyer, U., Zillessen, H., Covid-19 contact tracing and data protection can go together (2020) JMIR MHealth and UHealth, 8 (4), p. e19359; ACIP.

However, IEEE 802.11ax officially has not adaptive physical carrier sensing mechanism to be used with the SR techniques. The lack of adaptive carrier sensing leads to hidden/exposed nodes problems in dense networks. Also, it induces unfair access between the stations. Therefore, thorough the study, we try to solve how to design an adaptive carrier sensing mechanism to balance hidden/exposed problems and increase fairness for all stations in the dense WLANs. Consequently, we propose a two-scale Fair Sensitivity Control (FSC), which operates with both local-scale and global-scale to adjust the Carrier Sensitivity Threshold (CST) for stations. In contrast to other studies, we use local scale control to adaptively adjust CST to decrease interference and global-scale control using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to decrease the fairness issue caused by stations' placements. Thanks to the learning capabilities of the AI, specifically Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), that we have implemented in this work, the WLANs learn the particular carrier sensing parameter, called Margin for stations. We evaluate the FSC mechanism under the five metrics: i) aggregated throughput, (ii) number of collisions, (iii) number of hidden terminals, (iv) number of exposed terminals, and (v) fairness. Simulation results show a clear performance improvement over the five metrics compared with the current state of the art. © 2020 IEEE.",AI-based Sensitivity Control; IEEE 802.11ax; Intelligent Wi-Fi Networks; Smart Network Management,Multilayer neural networks; Scale (deposits); Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Concurrent transmission; Exposed terminal; Learning capabilities; Local scale control; Multi layer perceptron; Physical carrier sensing; Sensitivity control; Sensitivity threshold; IEEE Standards,,,,,,,,"Khorov, E., Kiryanov, A., Lyakhov, A., Bianchi, G., A tutorial on ieee 802. 11ax high efficiency wlans (2019) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 21 (1), pp. 197-216. , Firstquarter; Thorpe, C., Murphy, L., A survey of adaptive carrier sensing mechanisms for ieee 802. 11 wireless networks (2014) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 16 (3), pp. 1266-1293. , Third Quarter; Zhu, J., Metzler, B., Guo, X., Liu, Y., Adaptive csma for scalable network capacity in high-density wlan: A hardware prototyping approach (2006) Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 25TH IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications, pp. 1-10. , Barcelona; Smith, G., Dynamic Sensitivity control-v2, , IEEE 802. 11ax, IEEE 802. 11-13/1012r4; Afaqui, M.S., Garcia-Villegas, E., Lopez-Aguilera, E., Smith, G., Camps, D., Evaluation of dynamic sensitivity control algorithm for ieee 802. 11ax (2015) 2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), pp. 1060-1065. , New Orleans, LA; Selinis, I., Filo, M., Vahid, S., Rodriguez, J., Tafazolli, R., Evaluation of the dsc algorithm and the BSS color scheme in dense cellularlike ieee 802. 11ax deployments (2016) 2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC), pp. 1-7. , Valencia; Zhong, Z., Cao, F., Kulkarni, P., Fan, Z., Promise and perils of dynamic sensitivity control in ieee 802. 11ax wlans (2016) 2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS), pp. 439-444. , Poznan; Selinis, I., Katsaros, K., Vahid, S., Tafazolli, R., Control oBSS/pd sensitivity threshold for ieee 802. 11ax BSS color (2018) 2018 IEEE 29th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC), pp. 1-7. , Bologna; Afaqui, M.S., Garcia-Villegas, E., Lopez-Aguilera, E., Camps-Mur, D., Dynamic sensitivity control of access points for ieee 802. 11ax (2016) IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), pp. 1-7. , Kuala Lumpur; Jamil, I., Cariou, L., Hélard, J., Novel learning-based spatial reuse optimization in dense wlan deployments (2016) Springer EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking, p. 184; Gutierrez-Estevez, D.M., Canberk, B., Akyildiz, I.F., Spatiotemporal estimation for interference management in femtocell networks (2012) IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications- (PIMRC), pp. 1137-1142. , Sydney, NSW; Ariman, M., Seçinti, G., Erel, M., Canberk, B., Software defined wireless network testbed using raspberry pi of switches with routing addon (2015) IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Network (NFV-SDN), pp. 20-21. , San Francisco, CA; Wilhelmi, F., Barrachina-Munoz, S., Bellalta, B., Cano, C., Jonsson, A., Ram, V., A flexible machine-learning-aware architecture for future wlans (2020) IEEE Communications Magazine, 58 (3), pp. 25-31. , March; Merlin, S., TGax Simulation Scenarios, , https://mentor.ieee.org/802.11/dcn/14/11-14-0980-16-00ax-simulation-scenarios.docx, doc.

Generally, it is assumed that AI can enable machines to exhibit human-like intelligence, and is claimed to benefit to different areas of our lives. Since AI is fueled by data and is a distinct form of autonomous and self-learning agency, we are seeing increasing ethical concerns related to AI uses. In order to mitigate various ethical concerns, national and international organisations including governmental organisations, private sectors as well as research institutes have made extensive efforts by drafting ethical principles of AI, and having active discussions on ethics of AI within and beyond the AI community. This paper investigates these efforts with a focus on the identification of fundamental ethical principles of AI and their implementations. The review found that there is a convergence around limited principles and the most prevalent principles are transparency, justice and fairness, responsibility, non-maleficence, and privacy. The investigation suggests that ethical principles need to be combined with every stages of the AI lifecycle in the implementation to ensure that the AI system is designed, implemented and deployed in an ethical manner. Similar to ethical framework used in biomedical and clinical research, this paper suggests checklist-style questionnaires as benchmarks for the implementation of ethical principles of AI. © 2020 IEEE.",AI; ethical principles; implementation,Clinical research; Intelligent computing; Life cycle; Privacy by design; Surveys; AI systems; Ethical concerns; Ethical principles; Human-like intelligence; Personalisation; Private sectors; Research institutes; Self-learning; Philosophical aspects,,,,,,,,"Taddeo, M., Floridi, L., How AI can be a force for good (2018) Science, 361 (6404), pp. 751-752. , Aug; Zhou, J., Chen, F., AI in the public interest (2019) Closer to the Machine: Technical, Social, and Legal Aspects of AI, , C.

Virtuous artificial agents would blur traditional distinctions between different sorts of moral machines and could make a claim to membership in the moral community. Accordingly, we investigate the “machine question” by studying whether virtue or vice can be attributed to artificial intelligence; that is, are people willing to judge machines as possessing moral character? An experiment describes situations where either human or AI agents engage in virtuous or vicious behavior and experiment participants then judge their level of virtue or vice. The scenarios represent different virtue ethics domains of truth, justice, fear, wealth, and honor. Quantitative and qualitative analyses show that moral attributions are weakened for AIs compared to humans, and the reasoning and explanations for the attributions are varied and more complex. On “relational” views of membership in the moral community, virtuous machines would indeed be included, even if they are indeed weakened. Hence, while our moral relationships with artificial agents may be of the same types, they may yet remain substantively different than our relationships to human beings. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Agents; Artificial intelligence; Machine ethics; Moral psychology; Robot rights; Virtue ethics,Behavioral research; Philosophical aspects; Artificial agents; Human being; Moral agents; Moral theory; Quantitative and qualitative analysis; Traditional distinctions; Virtue ethics; Artificial intelligence,,,,,"Army Research Office, ARO: W911NF-19-1-0246

In the course of their lives humans usually search for their individual ikigai, ideally find it and hence devote time to it. As it is widely expected that both AI and XR will be increasingly disruptive of our known daily time use schedule, this will likely also have an impact on the space of potential ikigai. Since ikigai constitutes a vital component of the lives of humans, these consequences for ikigai have to be examined towards both ethical human enhancement as well as ikigai-friendly AI. In this paper the term 'i-risk' is introduced for undesirable scenarios in which humans and potentially also other minds are deprived of the pursuit of their individual ikigai. This paper outlines ikigai-related challenges as well as desiderata for the three categories XR/human enhancement, AI safety and AI welfare. © 2020 IEEE.",AI affordances; AI effect; AI safety; AI welfare;

One of these challenges is privacy. However, there is a tension between privacy, utility (model accuracy), and fairness. While de-identification techniques, such as generalisation and suppression, have been proposed to enable privacy protection, it comes with a cost, specifically to fairness and utility. Recent work on algorithmic fairness defines fairness as a guarantee of similar outputs for 'similar' inputs. This notion is discussed in connection to de-identification. This research investigates the trade-off between privacy, fairness, and utility. In contrast, other work investigates the trade-off between privacy and overall utility. In this research, we investigate the effects of two de-identification techniques, k-anonymity and differential privacy, on both utility and fairness. We propose two measures to calculate the trade-off between privacy-utility and privacy-fairness. Other research has provided guarantees for privacy regarding utility; this research focuses on the trade-offs given set de-identification levels and relies on these guarantees. We discuss the effects of de-identification on data of different characteristics: class imbalance, and outcome imbalance. We evaluated these effects on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. As a case study, we analysed the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey dataset. © 2020 IEEE.",accuracy; fairness; imbalance; machine learning; medicine; privacy,Economic and social effects; Intelligent computing; Class imbalance; De-identification; Differential privacies; Medical expenditures; Privacy protection; Real-world datasets; Sensitive datas; Synthetic datasets; Privacy by design,,,,,,,,"Sweeney, L., KAnonymity: A model for protecting privacy (2002) International Journal on Uncertainty,Fuzziness and KnowledgeBased Systems, 10 (5), pp. 1-14. , http://www.win.tue.nl/jhartog/CourseVerif/Papers/10.1.1.90.4099.pdf; Fung, B.C.M., Wang, K.E., Chen, R.U.I., Yu, P.S., Privacy-Preserving data publishing : A survey of recent developments (2010) ACM Computing Surveys (Csur), 42 (4); Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., Kirchner, L., Machine bias (2016) ProPublica, May, 23, p. 2016; Thomas, L., Crook, J., Edelman, D., (2017) Credit Scoring and Its Applications.

Under these laws, adequate protections must be in place to safeguard patients' health records, which are often big data comprised of free text. Machine learning approaches are extensively used for the automated de-identification of medical free text, with outstanding results obtained from several studies that incorporate long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. These networks are a variant of the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Our survey of LSTM models dates back five years, and the contribution of the findings is appreciable. Performance-wise, LSTMs generally surpassed other types of models used in automated de-identification of free text, namely conditional random field (CRF) algorithms and rule-based algorithms. In addition, hybrid or ensemble LSTM models did not outperform LSTM -only models. Finally, we note that the customization of gold-standard, de-identification datasets may result in overfitted models. © 2020 IEEE.",big data; de-identification; long short-term memory; machine learning; medical free text; recurrent neural network,Health insurance; Laws and legislation; Random processes; Surveys; Conditional random field; De-identification; Governmental regulations; Health insurance portability and accountability acts; Machine learning approaches; Patient information; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Rule based algorithms; Long short-term memory,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: CNS-1427536","We would like to thank the reviewers in the Data Mining and Machine Learning Laboratory at Florida Atlantic University.

Simultaneously, it becomes increasingly important to address emerging ramifications. Thereby, the focus is often set on ethical and safe design forestalling unintentional failures. However, cybersecurity-oriented approaches to AI safety additionally consider instantiations of intentional malice - including unethical malevolent AI design. Recently, an analogous emphasis on malicious actors has been expressed regarding security and safety for virtual reality (VR). In this vein, while the intersection of AI and VR (AIVR) offers a wide array of beneficial cross-fertilization possibilities, it is responsible to anticipate future malicious AIVR design from the onset on given the potential socio-psycho-technological impacts. For a simplified illustration, this paper analyzes the conceivable use case of Generative AI (here deepfake techniques) utilized for disinformation in immersive journalism. In our view, defenses against such future AIVR safety risks related to falsehood in immersive settings should be transdisciplinarily conceived from an immersive co-creation stance. As a first step, we motivate a cybersecurity-oriented procedure to generate defenses via immersive design fictions. Overall, there may be no panacea but updatable transdisciplinary tools including AIVR itself could be used to incrementally defend against malicious actors in AIVR. © 2020 IEEE.",AI; AI Safety; Cybersecurity; Design Fiction; Disinformation; HCI; Immersive Journalism; Psychology; VR,Security of data; Virtual reality; Co-creation; Cross fertilization; Cyber security; Immersive; Immersive designs; Safe designs; Safety risks; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,,,"Dafoe, A., (2018) AI Governance: A Research Agenda, , Governance of AI Program, Future of Humanity Institute, University of Oxford: Oxford, UK; Dignum, V., AI is multidisciplinary (2020) AI Matters, 5 (4), pp. 18-21; Hadfield-Menell, D., Russell, S.J., Abbeel, P., Dragan, A., Cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (2016) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3909-3917; Leike, J., Krueger, D., Everitt, T., Martic, M., Maini, V., Legg, S., (2018) Scalable Agent Alignment Via Reward Modeling: A Research Direction, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 1811.07871; Peters, D., Vold, K., Robinson, D., Calvo, R.A., Responsible AI-Two frameworks for ethical design practice (2020) IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society, 1 (1), pp. 34-47; Soares, N., Fallenstein, B., Agent foundations for aligning machine intelligence with human interests: A technical research agenda (2017) The Technological Singularity., pp. 103-125. , Springer; Asilomar, A., Principles.(2017) (2018) Principles Developed in Conjunction with the 2017 Asilomar Conference [Benevolent AI 2017]; Aliman, N.-M., Elands, P., Hürst, W., Kester, L., Thórisson, K.R., Werkhoven, P., Yampolskiy, R., Ziesche, S., Error-correction for AI safety (2020) International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence., pp. 12-22. , Springer; Brundage, M., Avin, S., Clark, J., Toner, H., Eckersley, P., Garfinkel, B., Dafoe, A., Filar, B., (2018) The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and Mitigation; Pistono, F., Yampolskiy, R.V., (2016) Unethical Research: How to Create A Malevolent Artificial Intelligence, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02817, CoRR, abs/1605.02817; Yampolskiy, R.V., Spellchecker, M., (2016) Artificial Intelligence Safety and Cybersecurity: A Timeline of AI Failures, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.07997; Pearlman, K., (2020) Virtual Reality Brings Real Risks: Are We Ready?, , USENIX Association; Casey, P., Baggili, I., Yarramreddy, A., Immersive virtual reality attacks and the human joystick (2019) IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing; Gulhane, A., Vyas, A., Mitra, R., Oruche, R., Hoefer, G., Valluripally, S., Calyam, P., Hoque, K.A., Security, privacy and safety risk assessment for virtual reality learning environment applications (2019) 2019 16th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC), pp. 1-9; Baldassi, S., Kohno, T., Roesner, F., Tian, M., (2018) Challenges and New Directions in Augmented Reality, Computer Security, and Neuroscience-part 1: Risks to Sensation and Perception, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.10557; De Guzman, J.A., Thilakarathna, K., Seneviratne, A., Security and privacy approaches in mixed reality: A literature survey (2019) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 52 (6), pp. 1-37; Happa, J., Glencross, M., Steed, A., Cyber security threats and challenges in collaborative mixed-reality (2019) Frontiers in ICT, 6, p. 5; (2019) 2019 Industry-Academia Summit on Mixed Reality Security, Privacy, and Safety: Summit Report, , https://ar-sec.cs.washington.edu/research.html, UW Allen School Security and Privacy Research Lab, online; accessed 04-August-2020; Yampolskiy, R.V., Taxonomy of pathways to dangerous artificial intelligence (2016) Workshops at the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Wang, M., Lyu, X.-Q., Li, Y.-J., Zhang, F.-L., VR content creation and exploration with deep learning: A survey (2020) Computational Visual Media, pp. 1-26; Bose, A.J., Aarabi, P., Virtual fakes: Deepfakes for virtual reality (2019) 2019 IEEE 21st International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP).

The article identifies six areas of concern, and maps them onto a proposed taxonomy of different kinds of ethical impact. The analysis uncovers a gap in the literature: currently user-centred approaches do not consider the interests of a variety of other stakeholders—as opposed to just the receivers of a recommendation—in assessing the ethical impacts of a recommender system. © 2020, The Author(s).",Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Digital ethics; Ethical trade-offs; Ethics of recommendation; Machine learning; Recommender systems,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Economic and social effects; Learning systems; Machine learning; Recommender systems; Areas of concerns; Digital ethics; Literature reviews; Systematic analysis; Trade off; User-centred; Philosophical aspects,,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/N023013/1","This work was supported by Privacy and Trust Stream?Social lead of the PETRAS Internet of Things research hub.

While every effort should be expended to ensure that issues of responsibility are addressed at each stage of technological progression, irresponsibility (meaning a lack of responsibility) is inherent within the nature of robotics technologies from a theoretical perspective that threatens to thwart the endeavour. This is because the concept of responsibility, despite being treated as such, is not monolithic: rather this seemingly unified concept consists of converging and confluent concepts that shape the idea of what we colloquially call responsibility. From a different perspective, robotics will be simultaneously responsible and irresponsible depending on the particular concept of responsibility that is foregrounded: an observation that cuts against the grain of the drive towards responsible robotics. This problem is further compounded by responsible design and development as contrasted to responsible use. From a different perspective, the difficulty in defining the concept of responsibility in robotics is because human responsibility is the main frame of reference. Robotic systems are increasingly expected to achieve the human-level performance, including the capacities associated with responsibility and other criteria which are necessary to act responsibly. This subsists within a larger phenomenon where the difference between humans and non-humans, be it animals or artificial systems, appears to be increasingly blurred, thereby disrupting orthodox understandings of responsibility. This paper seeks to supplement the responsible robotics impulse by proposing a complementary set of human rights directed specifically against the harms arising from robotic and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The relationship between responsibilities of the agent and the rights of the patient suggest that a rights regime is the other side of responsibility coin. The major distinction of this approach is to invert the power relationship: while human agents are perceived to control robotic patients, the prospect for this to become reversed is beginning. As robotic technologies become ever more sophisticated, and even genuinely complex, asserting human rights directly against robotic harms become increasingly important. Such an approach includes not only developing human rights that ‘protect’ humans (in a negative, defensive, sense) but also ‘strengthen’ people against the challenges introduced by robotics and AI (in a positive, empowering, manner) [This distinction parallels Berlin’s negative and positive concepts of liberty (Berlin, in Liberty, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002)], by emphasising the social and reflective character of the notion of humanness as well as the difference between the human and nonhuman. This will allow using the human frame of reference as constitutive of, rather than only subject to, the robotic and AI technologies, where it is human and not technology characteristics that shape the human rights framework in the first place. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",AI; Anthropocentrism; Human rights; Man-under-the-loop; Responsibility; Robotics,Artificial intelligence; Intelligent robots; Robotics; Social aspects; Anthropocentrism; Artificial intelligence technologies; Design and Development; Human rights; Human-level performance; Man-under-the-loop; Responsibility; Technology characteristics; Social robots,,,,,,,,"Abney, K., Robotics, ethical theory, and metaethics: A guide for the perplexed (2012) Robot ethics: The ethical and social implications of robotics, , Lin P, Abney K, Bekey G, (eds), MIT Press, Cambridge; Alger, J.M., Alger, S.F., Beyond mead: Symbolic interaction between humans and felines (1997) Society and Animals, 5, pp. 65-81; Arendt, H., (1994) Eichmann in Jerusalem: A report on the banality of evil, , Penguin, New York; Arkin, R., (2009) Governing lethal behavior in autonomous robots, , CRC Press, Boca Raton; Asaro, P.M., Robots and responsibility from a legal perspective (2007) Proceedings of the IEEE, pp. 20-24; Asaro, P.M., The liability problem for autonomous artificial agents (2016) AAAI Spring Symposium Series, pp. 190-194. , https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS16/, 21–23 March 2016, Stanford University; Ashrafian, H., Artificial intelligence and robot responsibilities: Innovating beyond rights (2014) Science and Engineering Ethics, 21, pp. 317-326; Beck, U., (1992) Risk society: Towards a new modernity, , SAGE Publications, London; Beck, U., Living in the world risk society: A hobhouse memorial public lecture given on Wednesday 15 February 2006 at the London School of Economics (2006) Economy and Society, 35, pp. 329-345; Becker, H.S., Mccall, M.M., (2009) Symbolic interaction and cultural studies, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Bekey, G.A., (2005) Autonomous robots: From biological inspiration to implementation and control, , MIT Press, Cambridge MA; Berlin, I., (2002) Liberty, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Blumer, H., (1986) Symbolic interactionism: Perspective and method, , University of California Press, California; Bostrom, N., Existential risks: Analyzing human extinction scenarios and related hazards (2002) Journal of Evolution and Technology, 9 (1). , https://www.jetpress.org/volume9/risks.html; Bostrom, N., (2014) Superintelligence: Paths, dangers, strategies, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bovens, M., (1998) The quest for responsibility: Accountability and citizenship in complex organisations, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Brooks, R.A., (2002) Flesh and machines: How robots will change us, , Pantheon Books, New York; Cane, P., (2002) Responsibility in law and morality, , Hart Publishing, Oxford; Capurro, R., NAGENBORG, M., (2009) Ethics and robotics, , IOS Press, Amsterdam; Coeckelbergh, M., Robot rights?

Such care robots recognize or estimate factors such as human states and then perform actions depending on the estimation results. If the humans cooperating with robots do not understand robot functions well, the task will not be performed appropriately. Additionally, it is possible that the estimation may be incorrect. Robots may make mistakes, and there is a risk that these mistakes may not be understood by humans. In such cases, robots are not useful, and this may hinder the cooperation between humans and robots. There are several ways to deal with this issue including improving estimation and information representation. We can know what is important to design care robots by analyzing the influence of factors including accurate estimation and contents and timing of information representation. We developed a robot for analysis that can support a human during standing, by raising its armrest. The developed robot raises its armrest when the user leans on it. In the nursing-care field, verbal communication is important. Hence, we also adopt a verbal guidance for information representation. Verbal guidance to encourage a user to stand up and countdown timer representations are adopted. Initially, an experiment is conducted to validate the usability of the system that acts according to considerably accurate estimations. The experimental results show that system without verbal guidance causes anxiety to humans and the system becomes not useful, even if the human state is detected accurately. Furthermore, we determine the appropriate content and timing of verbal guidance based on the results. Subsequently, we conduct an experiment to confirm that the proposed method is applicable under imperfect estimations. © 2020, The Author(s).",Accountability; Care robot; Human–robot interaction; Physically assistive system; Sit-to-stand support; Verbal guidance,Artificial intelligence; Machine design; Accountability; Accurate estimation; Assistive system; Imperfect estimations; Information representation; Robot interactions; Sit-to-stand; Verbal communications; Social robots,,,,,,We would like to thank Editage (http://www.editage.com) for English language editing.,,"Li, X., Xu, H., Cheung, J.T., Gait-force model and inertial measurement unit-based measurements: a new approach for gait analysis and balance monitoring (2016) J Exerc Sci Fit, 14 (2), pp. 60-66; Miezal, M., Taetz, B., Bleser, G., Real-time inertial lower body kinematics and ground contact estimation at anatomical foot points for agile human locomotion (2017) 2017 IEEE international conference on robotics and automation (ICRA), pp. 3256-3263. , (,),.

We use the causal theory of reference to explain how not just singular denoting expressions but also artifacts such as fingerprints and classifiers (broadly, 'denoting devices') denote individuals. Our current focus is on identity in criminal justice settings. The identity relation between denoting devices is an equivalence relation inducing equivalence classes that contain devices all of which denote the same individual. This is how information on individuals is typically fused. We see a case as a constellation of situations, to which investigators refer and in which information is recorded and transferred. We discuss how argumentation schemes support identity hypotheses, and how evidence for identity hypotheses from multiple sources is combined in Dempster-Shafer theory. Our framework can be applied in principle to any approach or technique for establishing identity hypotheses. The specific techniques of a domain (e.g., machine learning) are left to domain experts; we just incorporate them into our framework. © 2020 IEEE.",argumentation; argumentation schemes; biometric systems; Dempster-Shafer theory; identity; machine learning,Equivalence classes; Intelligent computing; Argumentation schemes; Causal theory; Criminal justice; Dempster-Shafer theory; Domain experts; Equivalence relations; General aspects; Multiple source; Computation theory,,,,,,,,"Hyman, J., Bantinaki, K., Depiction.
